# CI/CD Automation Pipeline Code Examples

## üìÇ Folder Structure

### `package_project.py`  
Manages Windows-to-Linux environment bridging

### `CI\BackendDeployTeamCity/`
Handles Unreal Engine backend builds and AWS deployments

### `CI\TeamCity-to-Cygwin/`  
Manages Windows-to-Linux environment bridging

## üîç Debug Symbol Processing (`package_project.py`)
Handles Unreal Engine Android symbol files (`libUnreal.so`) for Sentry crash reporting:


```python
   def compress_and_upload_symbols(ndk_path, symbols_path, sentry_cli_path, org, project, auth_token):
    """Compresses and uploads UE debug symbols to Sentry for Android crash reporting"""
```
Key Features:
Sentry Integration: Automates symbol upload for UE Android builds  

NDK Compression: Uses llvm-objcopy to reduce symbol file size by ~60%

CI Ready: Designed for build pipelines with environment variable support

UE-Specific Usage:
Ensure Sentry plugin is installed in your Unreal project

Configure in DefaultEngine.ini:

```ini
[Sentry]
Dsn=https://your-key@sentry.io/your-project
```
Call during Android builds:

```python
compress_and_upload_symbols(
    ndk_path="C:/AndroidNDK",
    symbols_path="Binaries/Android/ARM64",
    sentry_cli_path=find_sentry_cli(),
    org="your-game-studio",
    project="your-ue-project",
    auth_token=os.getenv("SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN")
```
